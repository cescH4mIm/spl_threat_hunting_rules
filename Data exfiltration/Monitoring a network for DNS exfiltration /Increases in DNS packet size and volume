Description:
You want to monitor your network for large DNS packets or an unusually high volume of DNS packets, both of which can be an early sign of data exfiltration.

Required data:
DNS data

Procedure:
Run the following search. You can optimize it by specifying an index and adjusting the time range. 

spl:
============================================================================================
eventtype="stream_dns" message_type="Query" 
| mvexpand query
| eval queryLength=len(query)
| stats count BY queryLength, src
| sort -queryLength, count
| table src queryLength count
| head 1000
============================================================================================

Search explanation:
eventtype="stream_dns" -> Search only Stream DNS events.
message_type="Query"   -> Search for queries.
| mvexpand query -> Create a new event for each value found in the query field.
| eval queryLength=len(query) -> Calculate the length of the string in the query field.
| stats count BY queryLength, src -> Count the number of times each query length and source combination occurred.
| sort -queryLength, count  ->  Sort results with the largest requests first.
| table src queryLength count ->  Display the results in a table with columns in the order shown.
| head 1000 ->  Show only the first 1,000 records.

Next steps:
Using the scatter chart visualization might help you see the outliers better. A high number of requests or large packets can indicate a security risk. For example, many common domains (www.google.com and www.bbc.co.uk) have a small query string length and will have a small query count. If, however, the malicious software opens a sensitive document thatâ€™s 5 Mb in size, chops it into 255-byte packets, and sends via DNS requests, then you're likely to see many 255-byte packets.
